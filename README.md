Realtime Sign Language to Text Conversion with Teachable Machine

# Abstract
This project aims to bridge communication gaps for individuals with hearing
impairments by developing a comprehensive system that can detect and interpret sign language
gestures, convert them into text, and then transform the text into speech. People with hearing
impairments often face challenges in effectively communicating with those who do not
understand sign language. This project addresses this issue by leveraging computer vision,
natural language processing (NLP), and speech synthesis technologies to facilitate seamless
communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not. The key
components of this project include, sign language detection, conversion to text and speech
conversion. Sign language detection is used to precisely detect and recognize user-made sign
language motions, the project makes use of computer vision techniques and deep learning
models. It uses in-the-moment image or video analysis to record and decipher body language,
face expressions, and hand movements. After the system picks up sign language signals, it is
converted into text. The movements are transformed into coherent textual representations using
Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. Using sophisticated speech synthesis
technology, the resulting text is subsequently converted to speech. This makes sure that people
who don't understand sign language can nevertheless understand the intended message.
Through the project's user-friendly interface, people with hearing loss can easily communicate
with both people who use sign language and others who rely on spoken language. Additionally,
it has the ability to be integrated into a variety of hardware and software, including PCs, tablets,
and smartphones, making it usable and adaptable for a variety of users. By easing
communication and promoting a more inclusive society, the "Sign Language Detection,
Conversion to Text, and Speech Conversion Project" has the potential to greatly enhance the
quality of life and social inclusion of people with hearing impairments.
